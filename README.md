# Cryptography Studies with Python

This repo contains a set of examples for implementing cryptography using Python. We have Alice and Bob trying to communicate, and Eve trying to crack and eavesdrop, exploiting flaws.

Topics covered:

 - Caesar Cipher (the biggest learning in Crypto (Kerckhoff's Principle)
 - Substitution Cipher (is security only dependent on the size of Key Space?)
 - One Time Pad (provable secure systems - what is the catch?)
 - Stream Ciphers (practical implementations of One Time Pads)
 - Block Ciphers (DES)
 - Key Exchange (implementing Diffie-Hellman)
 - Public Key Encryption (RSA + breaking RSA by factoring example)
